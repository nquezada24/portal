       <p>Hello my name is Natalia. I an emerging software devloper in the Greater Seattle area.</p>
       
       <p>A littie bit about myself, I am a true southerner, a Georgia Peach if you will. I have found myself in the Emerald city after move to few major cities. A few fun facts about me: I love my dog Luna, she is my child. I also know how to play and march the Tuba, I had the pleasure of doing marching band and participating in a wonderful organization called Atlanta CV Drum and Bugle Corps. It allowed me to work in a team setting with all age groups as young as 15 and as old as 76. It also gave me the opportunity to travel all over the East Coast. It shaped who I am as a person and really instilled a strong work eithc and a true appreciation working in a team setting.</p>
       
       <p> I orgianlly have a backround in the resturant industry and love the fast pace nature of the job. However, I am looking for a new adventure in tech as the possibilities are endless.
       
       <p>I have created this website to show case my skills and projects as I learn new languages and build some cool things. My goal is to start in front end development and eventually move into cloud computing.</p>
           
       <p>Thank you for check out my digtail portfolio. Above you will find projects I have compelted. I am in the porcess of learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You will also find my Linkedln and Github projects. I can't wait to conncet with you!  </p>
